When the Matlab 2016a was released initially, the openGL render was not compatible with some NVidia drivers in Linux. Recently, I have noticed that the last update of NVidia-367 driver has fixed this problem.
To install the nvidia-367 driver in Ubuntu 16.04, you need to uninstall the previous nvi...

<ul>
<li>Title: Advanced Topics in Quantum Optics (II)</li>

<ul>
<li>Main topics:

<li>Optical pumping</li>
<li>Laser cooling</li>
<li>matrix/tensor product state representation of many-body systems (let’s see if time permits)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Time slot: From June 1st to July 29th. Detailed schedule to be updated.</p></li>
<li>Main references:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://info.phys.unm.edu/~ideutsch/Classes/Phys566F15/index.htm">Quantum Optics I by Prof. Ivan Deutsch</a> (lecture videos, notes and homeworks are all available in the link).</li>
<li><a href="http://info.phys.unm.edu/~ideutsch/Classes/Phys531F11/index.htm">Atomic Physics course by Prof. Ivan Deutsch</a> (lecture videos, notes and homeworks are all available in the link).</li>
<li>A book, if you wish, as shown in the photo above by our friend <a href="http://cquic.unm.edu/member/yuan.yu.jau/">Yuan-Yu Jau</a> and others on Optical Pumping featured with simulation demo codes and detailed analysis.</li>
<li>A handful of classical papers to be updated here later.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Discussion forum: <a href="https://disqus.com/home/channel/quantumoptics">see this channel</a> I created recently.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The plan is to visit or revisit those lectures and do some homeworks and derivations, and reproduce some known results published in some reference papers. I may do some programming in Julia using our preliminary <a href="http://juliaquantum.github.io">JuliaQuantum libraries</a>, which is good to me since I will meet with Nik from Stanford in June to share our experiences on symbolic computing and simulating quantum control related stuffs in Julia, and then meet with our core JuliaQuantum developer Amir and a tensor network guru Jutho from Ghent to discuss some efficient ways to handle quantum objects in Julia. I hope some good ideas can be further transferred to the code base of the JuliaQuantum libraries under construction.</p>
<p>If you are interested in taking this challenge and fun study opportunity, feel free to contact me or comment below. Thanks!</p>
<h1 id="schedule-and-progress">Schedule and progress</h1>
<ul>
<li>[X] June 1st-5th:
<ul>
<li>[X] From Ivan’s QO lectures: Coherence, density matrix, Bloch-sphere, Rabi oscillations. Lecture notes #4-6, P.S. #2-4; Optical Bloch equations, Master equation, Damped two-level atom. Lecture notes #7-8, P.S. #5-6.</li>
<li>[X] From Yuan-Yu’s book: chapters 1-5 (Alkali atoms, wavefunction, Schrodinger space, density matrix, Liouville space, optical pumping of atoms).</li>
<li>[X] Get familiar with JuliaQuantum libraries: <a href="https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuBase.jl">QuBase.jl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuDirac.jl">QuDirac.jl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuDynamics.jl">QuDynamics.jl</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[X] June 6th-12th:
<ul>
<li>[X] From Ivan’s QO lectures: Quantization of the field, atoms+quantized field. Lecture notes #11-13, P.S. #7;</li>
<li>[X] From Ivan’s AP lectures: notes 10-13.</li>
<li>[X] From Yuan-Yu’s book: chapters 6-9.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[X] Skip June 13th-19th for more research work to be done. Then from June 20th-26th:
<ul>
<li>[X] Wrap up on Yuan-Yu’s book.</li>
<li>[X] A blog post on some essential points. See <a href="http://i2000s.github.io/2016/07/23/put-everything-on-a-quantum-circuit-part-i.html">this one</a> and more to come.</li>
<li>[X] Discuss with Nikolas as our visitor on symbolic calculus and quantum simulations in Julia.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A side note: I have to skip a month for preparing the workshop/conference and JuliaQuantum activities. Writing notes took much more time than I had expected as there were some Jekyll and plugin problems I had to solve on the first time. I will skip the topic on cooling processes for this summer study and will pick up a little bit on matrix product states before July 29th and will write some notes and discuss some important topics with JuliaQuantum members in the coming weeks. So, no further plan for the rest of summer study. Sorry about that. Please continue on if you are willing to learn more.</p>

<p>I am going to present our recent work in <a href="http://physics.unm.edu/SQuInT/2016/index.php">the 18th SQuInT Workshop</a> at Albuquerque, NM, USA. Below you can find my poster.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/posters/SQuInT2016-Nanofiber.pdf">Link to the PDF</a>.</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract:</h2>
<p>While optical fibers have been used for primary quantum communications, atom-fiber and atom-waveguide based quantum interfaces have been proposed as effective elements to implement a broad range of quantum information processing applications. We study the strong coupling between photons and atoms that can be achieved in an optical nanofiber geometry when the interaction is dispersive. While the Purcell enhancement factor for spontaneous emission into the guided mode does not reach the strong-coupling regime for individual atoms, one can obtain high cooperativity for ensembles of a few thousand atoms due to the tight confinement of the guided modes and constructive interference over the entire chain of trapped atoms. We studied the theory of the phase shift and polarization rotation induced on the guided light by the trapped atoms using the dyadic Green’s function method. The Green’s function is related to a full Heisenberg-Langevin treatment of the dispersive response of the quantized field to tensor polarizable atoms. In this talk, I will illustrate how do we apply our formalism to quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the atoms via polarimetry. We study shot-noise-limited detection of atom number for atoms in a completely mixed spin state and the squeezing of projection noise for atoms in clock states. Compared with squeezing of atomic ensembles in free space, we capitalize on unique features that arise in the nanofiber geometry including anisotropy of both the intensity and polarization of the guided modes. We use a first principles stochastic master equation to model the squeezing as function of time in the presence of decoherence due to optical pumping. We find a peak metrological squeezing of ~5 dB is achievable with current technology for ~2500 atoms. The theory established can be used to guide the design of nanofiber- or waveguide-based quantum interfaces.</p>

<p>Welcome to step 7 in <a href="/2015/05/10/rock_solid_code.html">your training as a scientific Python code ninja</a>: <strong>test automation</strong>.</p>
<p>Tests are extremely useful, as long as you run them. Unfortunately, a common pattern in many projects is this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Tests are written and run by the person who wrote them.</li>
<li>Others, and even the test-writer at a future date, forget to run the tests before committing new code. Or they decide not to run the tests because they forget how, or they don’t want to wait for the tests to finish.</li>
<li>The new code breaks the tests. By the time somebody notices, it’s too much trouble to go back and figure out where things went wrong, much less how to fix them.</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you avoid this? You make running the tests dead simple and fully automatic. This step is about making the tests run with a single command; step 8 is about having a machine run them whenever you commit code, without any action on your part.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, in <a href="/2015/05/15/write_tests.html">Step 5</a> we set things up so that the tests in one file could by run with a single command. But eventually, you will have tests in multiple files. Besides doctests, you may write additional tests. If you need to type 10, or even 3 commands to run them all, there will be a mental barrier and eventually you’ll get lazy.</p>
<h1 id="nose">nose</h1>
<p>There are a number of test automation tools for Python, but to keep things simple I will focus on the one I know best: <a href="https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">nose</a>. Nose does one simple thing: it automatically finds all the tests in your project and runs them. How does it know where the tests are? Well, it can easily recognize doctests, and it will also pick up any function whose name contains “test” and that is in file whose name contains “test”.</p>
<h1 id="what-to-do">What to do:</h1>
<p>As usual, this should only take two minutes.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>In case it isn’t installed already, do <code>pip install nose</code>.</li>
<li>First, go to your project directory and type <code>nosetests --with-doctest</code>. The nose executable is named “nosetests” and the option <code>--with-doctest</code> tells it to also run any doctests it finds. You should get a message saying that some number of tests were run, with an “OK” at the end.</li>
<li>To see how nosetests becomes really useful, either: (a) add a doctest in another file; or (b) add a file called <code>tests.py</code> containing at least one function with “test” in the name. The test function should check something and raise an exception if things are wrong. See <a href="https://github.com/ketch/rock-solid-code-demo/blob/master/tests.py">this example in my demo project</a>.</li>
<li>Now type <code>nosetests --with-doctest</code> again. You should see that your new tests were also run. To get more detailed output, try <code>nosetests --with-doctest --vs</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. Now, if you add more doctests or other tests, you can run them all just by typing <code>nosetests --with-doctest</code>. That’s the kind of thing you might want to add to your README. Your rule now should be:</p>
<p><strong>Always run the tests before you commit code.</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to step 6 in <a href="/2015/05/10/rock_solid_code.html">your training as a scientific Python code ninja</a>: <strong>issue tracking</strong>.</p>
<p>Look at you! You’ve got your nice code with some docstrings and tests, and you’re humming along analyzing data, simulating widgets, and whatnot. In the middle of it all, you realize that your regression analysis function breaks if you feed it more than 57 data points. And wouldn’t it be nice if it made a plot in addition to just printing out the correlation coefficient? And it would all be easier to use if your functions had default values for some of their arguments.</p>
<p>But you can’t stop to (fix that bug)/(add that feature)/(refactor that function) right now – you’re deep in all that beautiful data! Besides, maybe nobody will ever try to use this script with more than 57 data values. What should you do?</p>
<h2 id="raise-an-issue.">Raise an issue.</h2>
<p>An issue may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bug</li>
<li>A bit of code that works but needs to be improved</li>
<li>A potential feature enhancement</li>
</ul>
<p>Github – like other code repository services – has a built-in feature for tracking issues. When you raise an issue on your code’s Github repository, awesome things become possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a reminder to yourself of that thing that needs to be fixed</li>
<li>Everyone else who uses your code can be aware of it too</li>
<li>You and they can have a public discussion of what’s wrong and how to fix it (or what could be improved)</li>
<li>After it’s fixed/improved, you have a permanent record of the discussion and the improvements, that can be seen by anyone</li>
</ul>
<p>With Github’s issue tracker, there’s all kinds of additional goodness: issues are searchable, can reference one another, can reference people, can be tagged/labeled, and more. Check out <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">Github’s 10-minute explanation</a> to learn all about it.</p>
<h1 id="what-to-do">What to do:</h1>
<p>As usual, this should only take two minutes.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Think of at least one or two bugs, potential features, or improvements related to your project code. If you can’t think of any, either you haven’t been using the code much or you’re not thinking very hard.</li>
<li>Go to your project’s page in Github and click the issues button on the right side: <img src="/assets/img/github-issues-button.png" /></li>
<li>Click that big green “New Issue” button. Give the issue a title and an explanation. If it’s a bug, write down the exact sequence of commands that triggers it.</li>
<li>Click “Submit new issue”.</li>
<li>(for the future) When you eventually get around to solving the issue, you can mark it as “Closed”. This doesn’t delete it, but it removes it from the list of “Open” issues.</li>
</ol>
<p>You’re now at a page that lists all the issues for your project (presumably there’s just one so far). If you click on an issue, you find a page where you can write further comments and even have a conversation with other developers. If you’ve never seen such a conversation, take a look at some issues for bigger projects like <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues">IPython</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-openness">The benefits of openness</h2>
<p>It’s nice that you can keep your reminder list there in the issue tracker, but you may be worried about exposing all the shortcomings of your code in public. Don’t be! It’s much better to have them out in the open than to get surprised by them. In fact, the real magic happens when other people start reporting issues. If other people start using your code, you’ll find that somehow they run into a lot more problems than you do. Why? Because there are all kinds of unstated assumptions in your head that silently went into your code – but your users know nothing about them. So they will stress your code in completely different ways and help you find all sorts of wonderful bugs. They may even fix some of them for you – but that’s another subject. Just remember to be grateful – it’s easy to get your feathers ruffled when someone points out a flaw in your code, but in fact they are doing you a service.</p>
<p>This goes both ways. Your code almost certainly relies on a host of other projects, many of which are on Github or other servers with an issue tracker. Do you use Pandas, numpy, scipy, or scikit-learn? The next time you run into what might be a bug in those packages, be proactive. Of course you should first check Stack Overflow, but if it seems like a bug to you, you can go raise an issue on the project’s issue tracker. That’s right, anybody in the world can raise an issue – you don’t need to be one of the project developers. Just remember to be polite, and <a href="http://coenjacobs.me/effective-bug-reports-on-github/">follow a few best practices</a> when you report an issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ketch/rock-solid-code-demo/issues">Here’s what the issues page for my demo project looks like</a> after raising a couple of issues. And <a href="https://github.com/clawpack/pyclaw/issues">here’s the issue tracker for a larger collaborative project</a>. In academic research, I find that I open a lot more issues than I close. That’s okay – the issue tracker is not a to-do list that has to be fully completed at some point. It’s just a way of keeping track of useful improvements that could be made.</p>

<p>This is step 5 in your journey toward <a href="/2015/05/10/rock_solid_code.html">rock-solid scientific Python code</a>: <strong>write tests</strong>.</p>
<p>Tests? Ugh.</p>
<p>I hear you. Writing tests is not an inherently fun process. However, the alternative is debugging, staring at code and thinking real hard about what could be wrong, and more debugging. I’ll take writing tests any day of the week.</p>
<p>You may still not be convinced. Fortunately, I don’t have to convince you, because I’m not going to ask you to write tests in this step. As a matter of fact, I tricked you into writing tests in step 4. Remember those examples you put in your docstring?</p>
<p>Yeah, I’m sneaky like that.</p>
<p>What is a test? It’s a bit of code that uses your project code, together with assertions regarding the output. Here’s how you can use the docstring you wrote as a test:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to your project directory and identify the file to which you added one or more docstrings in step 4. We’ll refer to that as <code>my_file.py</code>.</li>
<li>At the command line (i.e., in a terminal), type <code>python -m doctest -v my_file.py</code> (but substitute the name of your file).</li>
<li>Look at the printed output to see if your test(s) passed.</li>
</ol>
<p>What just happened? Doctest is a python module that takes all the examples in your docstrings, runs them, and checks whether the output in the docstring matches the actual output. If any of your doctests failed, you should compare the actual output with your docstring and correct things.</p>
<p>I always forget how to invoke doctest, so I put the following code at the bottom of all my <code>.py</code> files:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">if</span> <span class="ot">__name__</span> == <span class="st">&quot;__main__&quot;</span>:
    <span class="ch">import</span> doctest
    doctest.testmod()</code></pre>
<p>After adding that, I can just do</p>
<pre><code>python my_file.py -v</code></pre>
<p>and it will automatically run the doctests. One warning: if you don’t add the <code>-v</code> flag (for verbose) on the command line, then there will be no printed output at all unless some test fails. And if you put <code>-v</code> before your filename, you’ll get something totally different.</p>
<p>Doctests are certainly not all there is to testing in Python, but for me they are a minimal-effort approach that makes my code much more reliable. If you add a docstring with a doctest to each function and module in your code, you’ll spend a lot less time debugging later on. I bet you’ll also find some bugs as you add the doctests.</p>
<p>From now on, just make it a habit to add a docstring and a doctest whenever you write a new function. Your future self will thank you.</p>

<!-- This is step 4 in your journey toward rock-solid scientific Python code.

<p>This is step 4 in your journey toward <a href="/2015/05/10/rock_solid_code.html">rock-solid scientific Python code</a>.</p>
<p>Steps 1-3 were language-agnostic, but now I’m going to assume you’re using Python. The Python language has a built-in feature for documenting functions, classes, and modules; it is the <strong>docstring</strong>. A docstring for a very simple function looks like this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> square(x):
    <span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="co">    Takes a number x and returns x*x.</span>

<span class="co">    Examples:</span>
<span class="co">    &gt;&gt;&gt; square(5)</span>
<span class="co">    25</span>
<span class="co">    &gt;&gt;&gt; square(2)</span>
<span class="co">    4</span>
<span class="co">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="kw">return</span> x*x</code></pre>
<p>The docstring is, of course, the part inside the triple quotes. If you type a function name followed by a “?” at the Python interpreter (or in a Jupyter notebook):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_function?</code></pre>
<p>then Python shows you the docstring for the function. If you’ve ever tried to get help on a function that had no docstring, you know the dark feeling of despair that attends such a moment. Don’t let your code be that code. Write docstrings!</p>
<p>For a somewhat longer docstring, see <a href="https://github.com/ketch/rock-solid-code-demo/blob/master/factor.py">my Gaussian elimination example</a>.</p>
<p>What should go in a docstring? Obviously, you should describe the arguments to the function and values returned by the function. But usually the most useful part of a docstring is examples. I’ll repeat that, because it’s important:</p>
<h2 id="examples-are-the-most-useful-part-of-a-docstring.">Examples are the most useful part of a docstring.</h2>
<p>Why? Often, the docstring written by the person who wrote the code includes a bunch of stuff that mattered when writing the code, but isn’t really important when using the code. Examples show precisely what you need to know to use the code.</p>
<p>Each example should show the function being called and its arguments, as well as the output. You should format your examples like those above, using “&gt;&gt;&gt;” before the input and putting the output on the next line. This is helpful not only because users are used to the convention, but because as we’ll see later it allows the computer to automatically run your examples and check that they give the expected outputs!</p>
<p>Here’s what to do:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the file with the most important functions in your project code. If you don’t have functions, open the main script file.</li>
<li>Add a docstring for one or two of the main functions (or at the top of the script). Make sure you include at least one example.</li>
<li>Open an IPython session or Jupyter notebook. Import your code and then call up the docstring using “?”. Make sure this works correctly.</li>
<li>Commit and push.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ketch/rock-solid-code-demo/blob/3784b04109b2ca92633a788cc02562898064282c/factor.py">Here’s what my demo repository looks like at this stage</a>.</p>
<h1 id="when-should-i-write-docstrings">When should I write docstrings?</h1>
<p>That’s easy: when you start writing a new function, before you write the code itself, add the docstring. Make it a habit! Of course, you can come back and refine the docstring as necessary after writing the code.</p>
<p>Now go to <a href="/2015/05/15/write_tests.html">step five</a>.</p>

<p>This is step 3 in your journey toward <a href="/2015/05/10/rock_solid_code.html">rock-solid scientific Python code</a>.</p>
<p>So your code is <a href="/2015/05/11/use_version_control.html">under version control</a> and it’s <a href="/2015/05/12/code_in_the_open.html">floating up there in the cloud</a>. In principle, someone else could use it. But how will they know it’s there? How will they know what it does, and how to install and use it?</p>
<h1 id="you-need-a-readme-file.">You need a README file.</h1>
<p>A README is minimalist documentation – just what is absolutely necessary for someone to start using your code. Most often, that someone is your future self, who has forgotten things. Here’s what to do:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to your project directory and open a new file. Call it README.md. The .md extension stands for Markdown, which is just an embellished format for text files that lets you add text formatting in simple ways that will automatically show up on Github. You can learn more about Markdown <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/">here</a>, but for the moment just think of it as a text file.</li>
<li>Write the contents of the README file. You should probably include:
<ul>
<li>a brief description of what your code does;</li>
<li>instructions for installing your code;</li>
<li>what other code needs to be installed for it to work;</li>
<li>one or two examples of how to invoke your code;</li>
<li>optionally: who wrote the code, how to cite it, and who to contact for help. One good example of a README file is <a href="https://github.com/github/markup/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Save and close the file.<br /></li>
<li>Add it to your repository with <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code>.</li>
<li>Push the file to github with <code>git push</code>.</li>
<li>Go to the page for your project on Github. You should see the contents of your README file displayed automatically right below the directory listing. It should look <a href="https://github.com/ketch/rock-solid-code-demo">something like this</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: it’s also possible (and even easier) to add a README directly on Github, by clicking that nice green button:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/github-readme-button.png" />
</figure>
<p>Nice work! Now others (or your future self) stand a decent chance of being able to use your code. But they may not want to use it in exactly the same way you do. In fact, there’s a good chance they may want to modify it, or incorporate it into some other code they have. By default, copyright laws don’t allow them to do that. If you want others to be able to use your code for their purposes…</p>
<h1 id="you-need-a-license-file.">You need a License file.</h1>
<p>This part is fairly painless because, unlike a README, the license you use should NOT generally be customized for your project. It’s much better to choose a standard license, so that other people don’t need to agonize over all the fine print. The most common licenses for open source scientific software are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-2-clause/">BSD</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-2.0/">GPL</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these allow others to use, redistribute, and modify your code. The GPL license imposes one restriction that is absent from the others: other code that uses yours must also be GPL. Some view this as a great way to encourage more free, open-source code. Others view it as an impediment to your code being used. My suggestion is to use a BSD license, but if you want to investigate in more detail, try <a href="http://choosealicense.com/">Choose A License</a> or go read <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3406002/">this paper</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s what to do:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a file called LICENSE.txt in your project directory.</li>
<li>Paste the license text (from one of the links above) into the file, save, and close.</li>
<li>Commit and push the file to Github.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it! Other folks can now legally adapt your code for their own purposes.</p>
<p>Congratulations on making it this far. Now go to <a href="/2015/05/14/write_docstrings.html">step four</a>.</p>
<h1 id="extra-credit-contributing.md-and-thanks.md">Extra credit: Contributing.md and Thanks.md</h1>
<p>It’s great that other people can now make improvements to your code. It would be even better if they sent those improvements back to you! To encourage that, you should add a Contributing.md file to tell them what your standards for acceptable code are and what the process is for adding code to your repository. Github provides a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/contribute-md/contribute-md-template/master/contribute.md">standard template for such a file</a>, though for small projects you can provide something much simpler. Some good examples of contributing files are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Puppet</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Factory_girl_rails</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If people have contributed to your project, it’s standard to have a file called Thanks.md that lists their names and contributions.</p>

<p>This is step 2 in your journey toward <a href="/2015/05/10/rock_solid_code.html">rock-solid scientific Python code</a>.</p>
<p>So you have your code under version control. Nice. But it’s sitting there on your computer. How do you share it with somebody else? And if they improve it, how do you incorporate their changes?</p>
<p>Version control is your first tool in this regard, too. Your second tool is Github (or Bitbucket, Google Code, etc.). Github is a website that will keep a backup copy of your code for free, and will allow others to download it, change it, and send you their changes. If that sounds great, read on. If you’re scared to put your code in the open because somebody might read it, ponder on <a href="http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=2064">this</a> and then read on.</p>
<h2 id="two-minutes-to-open-code">Two minutes to open code</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> and create an account.</li>
<li>Once you’re logged in, click on the “+” in the upper-right part of the screen and select “New repository”.</li>
<li>Give it the same name as your project, and write a short description.</li>
<li>Don’t initialize it with a README or license file (we’ll do that in Step #3).</li>
<li>Preferably, select “public” repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>Github will take you to a screen with different sets of instructions. Choose that one that says “…or push an existing repository from the command line” and type what is shown there into a terminal (in your project directory):</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>cd /my/project/directory
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/projectname.git
git push -u origin master</code></pre>
<p>Tada! You’ve just “pushed” your code to Github where it is made available to all the world! As a bonus, you can sleep soundly knowing that if your office floods and your house burns down tomorrow, your code will still be there waiting for you. The result should look something like <a href="https://github.com/ketch/rock-solid-code-demo">my demo</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more about using Github, take a few minutes to read the <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/git/02-collab.html">Software Carpentry lesson</a>.</p>
<p>Now <a href="/2015/05/13/add_a_readme.html">go on to step three</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome to step 1 in <a href="/2015/05/10/rock_solid_code.html">your training as a scientific Python code ninja</a>: version control. This is not going to be an in-depth course, so if you’re already using distributed version control (like Git or Mercurial), feel free to skip ahead to <a href="/2015/05/12/code_in_the_open.html">step 2</a>.</p>
<h2 id="life-before-version-control"><a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1531">Life before version control</a></h2>
<p>Programs change. That script I wrote last week to process my data needs to be adapted to a new file format or to produce a different kind of analysis. So I copy it to a new file and make some changes. I add a few lines and comment out others. The next week, I copy everything to a new directory so I can apply the code to a new project. A couple of months later, I realize that I have a mess of seven different directories, each with a dozen almost-identically-named files, and I am no longer sure which is the latest or what file does what. I spend a lot of time searching through and comparing the various files and directories to find what I need.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I email some version of the script to my collaborator, who also copies and modifies it. Each of us makes different improvements to it. I’d like to have one version with all the improvements, but how to extract the right bits from all the copies?</p>
<p>Later, I find that my current version of the script doesn’t work with some old data that I need to re-analyze in order to revise a paper. Where is the old version of the script that worked with that data? Or does it even exist?</p>
<h2 id="version-control">Version control</h2>
<p>Version control software can help you solve all of these problems. It keeps a record of the history of your code and shows you the changes you made at each step. You can easily switch between different versions, or merge contributions from different authors.</p>
<p>There are many version control systems in use. If you haven’t used one before, it’s best to find out what your collaborators use and start with that. If nobody you work with is using version control, I recommend that you use Git. It has become the most widely used version control system for new projects.</p>
<h2 id="two-minutes-to-version-control">Two minutes to version control</h2>
<p>If you’re on a Mac- or Linux-based system, you probably already have git. To check, just open a terminal and type</p>
<pre><code>git</code></pre>
<p>If you don’t have it, get it here: http://git-scm.com/downloads. Then take a moment to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#setting-up-git">set up git</a>. You’ll only have to do that once on a given computer.</p>
<p>Then do the following (replacing the directory and file names with the directory and files pertaining to your project):</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>cd my/project/
git init
git add project_file1
git add project_file2
...</code></pre>
<p>Go ahead and add all the relevant files. When you’re done, tell git to start keeping track of them by doing</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m &quot;Starting to keep this project under version control.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>That’s it! To get a first idea of what’s going on, try</p>
<pre><code>git status</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>git log</code></pre>
<p>To get a much better idea, take 15 minutes and go read the <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/git/01-backup.html">first software carpentry lesson on version control</a>.</p>
<p>You can get by for awhile with just the few git commands listed above. Eventually, you will want to go beyond what is described in the Software Carpentry lesson. When you do, it’s worth reading an extended introduction <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">like this one</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/2015/05/12/code_in_the_open.html">Continue to step two</a>.</p>
<h2 id="extra-credit-dont-copy-paste">Extra credit: Don’t copy-paste</h2>
<p>Version control is really just one tool that will help you with a general principle of code development:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Don’t duplicate.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, this means things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have two functions that are almost identical, combine them (or the identical parts of them) into one.</li>
<li>Don’t comment/uncomment lines of code in order to control the behavior of your code. Instead, use “if” statements and function arguments.</li>
<li>If you need to apply some code to two different projects, don’t copy the file. Put it on your path.</li>
</ul>
